# This is the Code of my two-side matching algorithm
## 1. The simulation of the data in DataMaking.ipynb .
## 2. The FIFO algorithm id in Match1.ipynb
## 3. The Linear programing is in LinearProgramming.ipynb
## 4. The DC-G-S algorithm is in Match2.ipynb
### Because of the size of thr Data is so big, we will upload it later
